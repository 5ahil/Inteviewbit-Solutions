/*There are two sorted arrays A and B of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays ( The median of the array formed by merging both the arrays ).

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Sample Input

A : [1 4 5]
B : [2 3]

Sample Output

3
 NOTE: IF the number of elements in the merged array is even, then the median is the average of n / 2 th and n/2 + 1th element. 
For example, if the array is [1 2 3 4], the median is (2 + 3) / 2.0 = 2.5

    // Do not write main() function.
