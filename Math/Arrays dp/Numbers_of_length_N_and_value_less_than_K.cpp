/*Given a set of digits (A) in sorted order, find how many numbers of length B are possible whose value is less than number C.

 NOTE: All numbers can only have digits from the given set. 
Examples:

	Input:
	  0 1 5  
	  1  
	  2  
	Output:  
	  2 (0 and 1 are possible)  

	Input:
	  0 1 2 5  
	  2  
	  21  
	Output:
	  5 (10, 11, 12, 15, 20 are possible)
Constraints:

    1 <= B <= 9, 0 <= C <= 1e9 & 0 <= A[i] <= 9
